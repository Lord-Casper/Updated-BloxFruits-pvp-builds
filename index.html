        <div id="build1" class="build">
            <h2>1. E-Claw Rumble Yama Kabucha</h2>
            <p>This build is quite versatile with great potential in both air and ground-based PvP. Adding cyborg makes it overpowered. The stats you need are Melee, Defense, and Sword. There are many one-shot combos with this build, making it good for dealing with teamers, runners, and air campers.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="build2" class="build">
            <h2>2. Superhuman Rumble Soul Cane Acidum Rifle</h2>
            <p>This build works well with cyborg, and is made specifically for 1v1s, making it perfect for bounty hunting when there is only one opponent. It excels in both land and air combat. The Acidum Rifle moves are easy to hit, making the combos easy to execute. You can obtain this build in the 2nd sea, and it can fence a 30 million bounty quite fairly.</p>
        </div>

            <h2>3. Superhuman/Godhuman Gravity Kabucha Gravity Cane</h2>
            <p>This build is similar to the ice build but requires more skill and can be more effective if performed correctly. Its effectiveness depends on the user’s skill, making it either a great threat or nothing to worry about.</p>

            <h2>5. E-Claw Rumble Bisento-v2/Spikey Trident Kabucha</h2>
